Earlier this month, I came across an interesting betslip on Kalshi.
Kalshi is a prediction market where we the users are allowed to trade on the outcomes of various real-world events, including sports, politics, weather, and financial markets. 
Unlike traditional sportsbooks, Kalshi operates as a financial exchange, where contracts are priced based on the probabilities of specific events occurring, and users can buy or sell these event contracts
