This was an essay that I wrote back in my first semester at the University of Arizona for English 101. Shoutout to professor Rios who helped me thinking through this.

## An Outcast
Street dogs are a ubiquitous part of the Indian landscape, you can find them roaming in every nook and cranny of India from the beaches of South India to the snow capped glaciers in Kashmir. Commonly referred to as “Indies” these free-living dogs are engraved into the ecosystem of Indian street life, standing in stark contrast to the culture of pet ownership found in the West. In fact, one lives in my house too , a two-year-old indie-German shepherd mix that goes by the name of Obi. Walking my dog in the mornings I was always confronted with the same question ‘What breed is your dog?’ My initial response was that he was just a ‘dog’, and I found the notion that my dog is a ' just a dog' very fascinating. The idea that dogs do not necessarily belong to a particular breed along with no immediate classification, making my dog a 'dog' with no breed or no immediate identifiers an outcast.

When the British came to India, they introduced foreign dog breeds and called the indigenous dogs “indie pariah dogs” or “Indian outcast dogs.” Consequently, as the world moved on so did the domestication of pedigree dogs and more foreign breeds became popular, leading to the Indie to be known as those “stray” dogs and “street” dogs, turning them into outcasts overnight

Indies spend most of their time relaxing and sleeping, searching for food, water, and shelter while being subjected to accidental and intentional human-induced harms such as road traffic  accidents, being chased away, culling, and deliberate cruelty. Most of the time indies are widely feared because some carry rabies, and for good reason, the World Health Organization estimates that rabies kills about 20,000 people in India each year. That equates to 36% of all rabies deaths worldwide and a large majority of these deaths come from the Indie. In fear people resort to carrying sticks or throwing rocks at dogs as a deterrent as in the off chance that some vicious dogs roam the streets one must have a means of self-defense.

Dogs in general are territorial, but indies are far more territorial and aggressive, and they will always defend what is theirs. That's why they act aggressive and fight if someone is deemed a threat towards them. The fear in people along with some semblance of vengeance leads to many riling these dogs up and this all equates to a recipe for disaster, a dog attack. Due to these unfortunate dog bite and attack incidents, many people in India regard these dogs as a menace and a threat. They only pay attention to news about dog attacks and ignore all news about human atrocities against these animals. Unfortunately, fear and ignorance have led many Indians and officials to see street dogs as nothing but a nuisance and to seek eradication using inhumane methods such as poisoning and beating. As inhumane and as unethical as this sounds there is a story about animal abuse weekly in the news and this can all be avoided through communicating with the dog as daunting as the task may sound it is one of the only methods of changing the mindset of the population. I too was. A bit nervous and scared when I stepped into BMAD (Besant Memorial Animal Dispensary), I was going to be a volunteer taking care of over 200 abandoned, neglected dogs. Working thrice a week and spending over twenty hours a week with these dogs really opened my eyes and changed me. 

Communicating with dogs is very easy and with indies it is as simple as bringing them a high value treat such as a cracker or a biscuit. Keep your distance and place the treat gently, each time you place a treat move slowly towards them so that they feel comfortable with you. Repeat this process for about 4 days, and you'll have a new companion. Befriend them rather than villainize them and turn them from a ferocious foe to a furry friend.

Over a millennium, Indian street dogs have formed their own pseudo-breed standard through natural selection: a short coat, triangular ears that point and stand upright, a curved tail, lean physique, and unwavering loyalty to humans who show them the slightest kindness. Despite the affection and love that these Indies show us humans, not many are adopting them and reciprocating that love back to them. This quote from Manav Sachdeva really encapsulates the mindset Indians have towards Indies; "No one wants our own country’s dog. these dogs never deserved to be labelled as “stray” dogs. They were, they are, and they always will be Indian dogs". When it comes to dogs, everyone gravitates towards a Labrador or German Shepherd, sometimes even more exotic breeds like Huskies and Poodles. I am in no way encouraging you to not get any of those dogs, all dogs are great and provide immense joy and happiness, rather I am providing another angle the perspective of dog ownership in India and the neglect towards the indigenous breeds of India.
