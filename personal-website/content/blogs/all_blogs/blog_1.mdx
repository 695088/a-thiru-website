Earlier this month, I came across an interesting betslip on Kalshi.
Kalshi is a prediction market where we the users are allowed to trade on the outcomes of various real-world events, including sports, politics, weather, and financial markets. 
Unlike traditional sportsbooks, Kalshi operates as a financial exchange, where contracts are priced based on the probabilities of specific events occurring, and users can buy or sell these event contracts

## Introduction

The field of computational design has grown substantially over the past decade. What once seemed like a niche area at the intersection of computer science and design has become a mainstream practice.

## Key Concepts

Computational design is not merely about using software to create designs. Rather, it's about understanding how algorithms, data structures, and computational processes can be used as creative mediums themselves.

### Algorithmic Thinking

Algorithmic thinking involves breaking down complex problems into discrete, solvable components. This approach allows designers to:

- Explore large solution spaces systematically
- Create generative systems
- Iterate on designs programmatically

## Case Study

<D3Visualization 
  type="line" 
  data={[
    { x: 0, y: 10 },
    { x: 1, y: 15 },
    { x: 2, y: 12 },
    { x: 3, y: 20 },
    { x: 4, y: 18 },
    { x: 5, y: 25 }
  ]} 
/>

## Interactive Visualization

Here's an example of how computational design can create dynamic visualizations:

<Chart 
  data={[{
    x: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    y: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11],
    type: 'scatter',
    mode: 'lines+markers',
    marker: { color: 'black' }
  }]}
  layout={{
    title: 'Design Iteration Progress',
    xaxis: { title: 'Iteration' },
    yaxis: { title: 'Quality Score' }
  }}
/>

## Conclusion

Computational design represents an exciting frontier where mathematics, programming, and aesthetics converge. As we continue to explore this space, I believe we'll discover new ways of thinking about both computation and design.
